# ReMo-XYZ: Book Cover Recognition App

A Next.js application that allows users to upload book covers and recognize book information using AI models. Users can manage their book library, edit recognized information, and delete books as needed.

## Features

- 📚 Upload and recognize book covers
- 🤖 Multiple AI model options (mock implementation)
- 📝 Edit recognized book information
- 🗃️ View and manage book library
- 🖼️ Image upload with drag-and-drop support
- 🎨 Modern UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have installed:

- Node.js 18.17 or later
- npm (comes with Node.js)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/remo-xyz.git
cd remo-xyz
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create required directories:

```bash
mkdir -p data public/uploads
```

4. Create initial data file:

```bash
echo "[]" > data/books.json
```

## Development

1. Start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

To use the `Llama3.2-vision` model, download and install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/download). Then run

```
ollama pull llama3.2-vision
ollama serve
```

After that you can use the model in your browser by click `Process Images`. Be patient while processing :)

## Important Notes

- The `data` directory must have write permissions for storing book information
- The `public/uploads` directory must have write permissions for storing images
- The current implementation uses mock AI responses for book recognition
- All data is stored locally in the `data/books.json` file
- Uploaded images are stored in `public/uploads`

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build the application
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## Features

### Scan Page

- Upload book covers via drag-and-drop or file selection
- Choose from multiple AI models for recognition
